The Notice also provides information regarding your privacy rights and choices.

The information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you interact with us, the products or services you use, and the choices you make.

If you disclose any personal data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our products and services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Notice. We may collect personal data about you from different sources and in various ways, including: Directly from you.

DATA RETENTION We generally retain your personal data as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, as required to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, as necessary to resolve disputes, as otherwise requested by you, or as required or permitted by applicable law.
