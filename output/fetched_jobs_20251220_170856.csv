The Notice also provides information regarding your privacy rights and choices. This Notice includes the following sections: SCOPE OF THIS NOTICE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT VEHICLES CHARGING MOBILE APP WEBSITE AND OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH US LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA DATA RETENTION DATA SECURITY INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS CHIDLREN'S DATA U.S. STATE PRIVACY DISCLOSURES CHANGES TO THIS NOTICE CONTACT US 1. SCOPE OF THIS NOTICE This Notice uses the Terms “Rivian,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” which refers to Rivian Automotive, LLC or its affiliate (“Rivian” or “Company”) that offers the relevant product or service you have used, with which you have interacted, with which you have entered into a contract, or that has otherwise collected and/or processed your personal data (also referred to as personal information in some jurisdictions).

PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT We collect and use personal data for a number of purposes, including to provide and continuously improve our products and services, such as increasing the range and reliability of Rivian vehicles and identifying opportunities to make your journey even safer. The information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you interact with us, the products or services you use, and the choices you make.

If you disclose any personal data relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our products and services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Notice. We may collect personal data about you from different sources and in various ways, including: Directly from you.
