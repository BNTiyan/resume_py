I'm excited about the Data Analyst at adp because the responsibilities align with my focus on building reliable, scalable systems. I blend ML/data engineering with strong software craft, which maps closely to your requirements around impact and execution. Recent work highlights include: • Lead AI governance and MLOps initiatives using Databricks, Hex, GitLab, and Vertex AI to secure developer platforms. • Implement automated security patching, vulnerability assessment systems, and ML-based threat detection models. • Deploy robust AI/ML solutions integrating NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib. Key strengths for this role: ml. adp's emphasis on thoughtful engineering and real-world outcomes resonates with my approach. I'd value the chance to contribute quickly, collaborate across functions, and raise the bar on quality and speed.
